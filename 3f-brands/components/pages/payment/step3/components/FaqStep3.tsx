You can choose the number of years and the amount yourself. At the beginning of each calendar year, the support will automatically be deducted from the account you specify. If you change your mind, you can cancel the yearly support authorization anytime via a link sent to your email or through your supporter dashboard. This method doesn't support crypto currency.",
